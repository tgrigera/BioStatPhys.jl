However, sometimes  it is more convenient to maintain running estimates of mean and/or variance, adding new data as it pops up, without storing the whole dataset in an array.  One way of achieving this is with West's recursion formula, which we implement here.","category":"page"},{"location":"stat/","page":"General statistical tools","title":"General statistical tools","text":"CurrentModule = BioStatPhys","category":"page"},{"location":"stat/#Unweighted-data","page":"General statistical tools","title":"Unweighted data","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"stat/","page":"General statistical tools","title":"General statistical tools","text":"MeanVar\npush!(MV::MeanVar,x)\nmean(MV::MeanVar)\nvar(MV::MeanVar)","category":"page"},{"location":"stat/#BioStatPhys.MeanVar","page":"General statistical tools","title":"BioStatPhys.MeanVar","text":"MeanVar\n\nType to allow running computation of mean and variance (i.e. without storing the data points).\n\nAfter the object is created with MeanVar(), data are fed one at a time with push!, causing the internal state to be updated but without storing the new data point (MeanVar requires a fixed amount of storage: two real numbers and an integer).
