    space_correlation(binning::DistanceBinning, X; connected=true, normalized=false, Xmean=nothing)

Compute space correlation of scalar signal `X` in an isotropic,
space-translation-invariant system using the given `DistanceBinning`.
Since the system is assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous,
correlations should depend only on the distances among the pairs, so
return a tuple `(r,C)` where `r` is a vector of distances and `C` the
correlation function at the corresponding distance.

Positions are assumed to be fixed in all configurations, with only the
signal changing value.

 - `X`: a matrix where each column holds the signal at different
   positions in space and at a given time.  All columns are used to
   average the correlation estimate over configurations.

 - `binning`: instead of positions, this function expects a pre-built
   [`DistanceBinning`](@ref) object holding lists of pairs separated
   by distances in the given range, such as the binnings created by
   [`distance_binning`](@ref).

 - `connected`: If true, compute the connected correlation,
   i.e. subtracting the mean of the signal.  If `Xmean` is `nothing`,
   space-averaging is used, i.e. at each configuration (column) the
   mean of `X` is computed and subtracted.  For phase averaging, give
   a precomputed mean in `Xmean`.

 - `normalized`: If `true`, normalize by ``C(r=0)``.

correlation length is much shorter or much larger than ``L``
